	<h2>Day 7:</h2>
		<p>It's already day 7 of the CS4CS program... It's hard to believe that the program is almost halfway done. We've already learned so much and learning about cybersecurity has been an eye-opening experience (even though I'm a little paranoid now). So far, I think making a website is one of the most interesting things we've done, but Python was also interesting even though it took time to get the hang of it. I'm really glad I decided to come here even though the B train is PACKED in the mornings.</p>

		<h2>Day 9:</h2>
			<p>Ariana Venti went missing! No, this is not a false alarm, and we're not talking about Ariana Grande either. People closer to Venti revealed that she got a text message relating to a family emergency that she had to attend to immediately, instead of performing at Coachella. Girls at the program CS4CS helped out with the investigation and they revealed that her disappearance may be more than just a family affair. Apparently, Venti had secret ties to Beyond-C, and asked her to do some shady things on Venti's own laptop. Experts say that this investigation could not have been possible without the CS4CS girls' input and expertise. Updates are yet to come.
