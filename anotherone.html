<h1>My CS4CS Blog</h1>
	<h2>Day 7:</h2>
		<p>It's already day 7 of the CS4CS program... It's hard to believe that the program is almost halfway done. We've already learned so much and learning about cybersecurity has been an eye-opening experience (even though I'm a little paranoid now). So far, I think making a website is one of the most interesting things we've done, but Python was also interesting even though it took time to get the hang of it. I'm really glad I decided to come here even though the B train is PACKED in the mornings.</p>
