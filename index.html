<h2>All About Me</h2>
<p>Hi I'm Stephanie and I'm going into 10th grade. I have a brother and a sister. I like to play tennis and my all-time favorite player is Roger Federer. I also like to read a lot and I really like Harry Potter and Throne of Glass. I don't really know much about coding or cybersecurity but I thought this course sounded interesting so I took it.</p>
